	Short: "A service to proxy and cache map tile layers",
	Long: `Tilegroxy is an extensible CLI application that proxies mapping layers to external providers and adds cacheing and protection in front. 

	Tilegroxy is meant to be used to power "ZXY" tile layers commonly used in web mapping applications and only provides endpoints in this scheme.  
	However one use of tilegroxy is as an adapter to convert other mapping APIs such as WMS to a simple tile layer. Any API that returns georeferenced
	imagery can be used with tilegroxy.
	
	See the documentation at TODO for configuration instructions.`,
