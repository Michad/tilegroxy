= Why tilegroxy?

Tilegroxy shines when you consume maps from multiple sources.  It isn't tied to any one mapping backend and can pull data from any protocol, whether the standard alphabet soup or a proprietary, authenticated API. Rather than make your frontend aware of every single vendor and exposing your keys, utilize tilegroxy and provide a uniform API with a configuration-driven backend that can be augmented by code when necessary.

== Documentation

**Prebuilt Documentation for the most recent release is available link:https://tilegroxy.michael.davis.name[here]. **

Documentation is served by tilegroxy at `/docs` (disable this behaviour by setting `Server.Production=true`). Documentation is powered by link:https://antora.org[Antora] with raw AsciiDoc located in link:./docs[docs]

= How to get it

Tilegroxy is available as a standalone executable or a container image. It's recommended you utilize a container for any serious deployment while the standalone executable can be useful to run locally while building your configuration.

== Building

Tilegroxy builds as an executable binary with minimal dynamic dependencies. Prebuilt binaries are available from https://github.com/Michad/tilegroxy/releases[Github].

Building tilegroxy yourself requires a bash-like shell with go 1.22, node 20, git, make, and standard POSIX utilities like date.  It uses a conventional link:https://github.com/Michad/tilegroxy/blob/main/Makefile[Makefile] workflow:

Build with

----
make
----

then install with

----
sudo make install
----

Once installed, tilegroxy can be invoked via the available link:https://tilegroxy.michael.davis.name/operation/commands/index.html[commands] such as `tilegroxy serve`. A systemd unit file for operation as a server daemon is left as an exercise for the reader.

=== Tests

The build includes integration tests that use https://golang.testcontainers.org/[testcontainers].  This requires you have either docker or podman installed and running. If you encounter difficulties running these tests it's recommended you use a prebuilt binary.  That said, you can also build with just unit tests using:

----
make clean build unit
----

See link:https://tilegroxy.michael.davis.name/development/tests.html[developer documentation] for more details.

== Docker

Tilegroxy is available as a container image on the Github container repository.

You can pull the most recent versioned release with the `latest` tag and the very latest (and maybe buggy) build with the `edge` tag. Tags are also available for version numbers.  https://github.com/Michad/tilegroxy/pkgs/container/tilegroxy[See here for a full list].

For example:

----
docker pull ghcr.io/michad/tilegroxy:latest
----

To then run tilegroxy:

----
docker run --rm -v ./test_config.yml:/tilegroxy/tilegroxy.yml:Z ghcr.io/michad/tilegroxy seed -l osm -z 0 -v
----

You can of course build the docker image yourself:

----
docker build . -t tilegroxy
----

An example link:https://github.com/Michad/tilegroxy/blob/main/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml] is included that can be used to start the tilegroxy server. It assumes using a configuration file named "test_config.yml" is located in the current working directory.

### Kubernetes

== Extending tilegroxy

One of the top design goals of tilegroxy is to be highly flexible. If there's functionality you need, there's a couple different ways you can add it in.  See the link:https://tilegroxy.michael.davis.name/operation/extensibility.adoc[extensibility documentation] for instructions.

== Contributing

As this is a young project any contribution via an Issue or Pull Request is very welcome.

A few please and thank yous:

* Follow https://go.dev/doc/effective_go[go conventions] and the patterns you see elsewhere in the codebase.  Linters are configured in Github Actions, they can be run locally with `make lint`
* Use https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716[semantic] / https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[conventional] commit messages.
* Open an issue for discussion before making large, fundamental change/refactors
* Ensure you add tests. You can use `make coverage` to ensure you're not dropping coverage.

Very niche providers might be declined. Those are best suited as custom providers outside the core platform.
