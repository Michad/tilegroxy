== Extending tilegroxy

One of the top design goals of tilegroxy is to be highly flexible. If there's functionality you need, there's a couple different ways you can add it in.  See the xref:./docs/extensibility.adoc[extensibility documentation] for instructions.

== Contributing

As this is a young project any contribution via an Issue or Pull Request is very welcome.

A few please and thank yous:

* Follow https://go.dev/doc/effective_go[go conventions] and the patterns you see elsewhere in the codebase.  Linters are configured in Github Actions, they can be run locally with `make lint`
* Use https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716[semantic] / https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[conventional] commit messages.
* Open an issue for discussion before making large, fundamental change/refactors
* Ensure you add tests. You can use `make coverage` to ensure you're not dropping coverage.

Very niche providers might be declined. Those are best suited as custom providers outside the core platform.
