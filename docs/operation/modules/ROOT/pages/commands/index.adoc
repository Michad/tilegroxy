= Commands

The `tilegroxy` executable is a standard https://github.com/spf13/cobra[cobra] program with a handful of commands available. If you're deploying tilegroxy for use as a webserver you want to use the `serve` command. A couple other commands are available to aid in standing up and administering a tilegroxy deployment.
