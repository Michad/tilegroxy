= Test

Tests your layers and cache are correctly configured and working by performing end-to-end tests.

Full, up-to-date usage information can be found with `tilegroxy test -h`.

----
Tests that everything is working end-to-end for all or some layers
including caching. This goes further than 'config check' and instead of
just validating the configuration can be parsed it actually makes sample
request(s) and populates the result in the cache. This is similar to
running 'seed' for a single tile or standing up the server and making a
cURL request for each layer. The output will list each layer and the
status, with any error encountered if applicable.

This test uses an arbitrary tile coordinate to test with. The default
coordinate might be outside the bounds of your map layer, there is
currently no logic to consider the bounds configured for each layer; you
will need to specify an applicable tile to use.  It is not recommended to
use 0,0,0 due to potential performance issues when dealing with large
data. If your cache is configured to prevent overwriting existing items
you might need to pick a distinct tile each time you run the test or run
with cache disabled (--no-cache).

Example:

        tilegroxy test -c test_config.yml -l osm -z 10 -x 123 -y 534

Usage:
  tilegroxy test [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help                help for test
  -l, --layer strings       The ID(s) of the layer to test. Tests all
                            layers by default
      --no-cache            Don't write to the cache. The Cache
                            configuration must still be syntactically valid
  -t, --threads uint16      How many layers to test at once. Be mindful of
                            spamming upstream providers (default 1)
  -x, --x-coordinate uint   The x coordinate to use to test (default 123)
  -y, --y-coordinate uint   The y coordinate to use to test (default 534)
  -z, --z-coordinate uint   The z coordinate to use to test (default 10)
