= Secret

Configuring a Secret source allows you to pull keys, passwords, or any other sensitive value from an external secret store rather than placing them in your configuration directly.  This is similar to the way you can reference environmental variables.  Secrets loaded in this way are never written to disk.  Properly externalizing secrets allows you to place your configuration into source control without modification.

Once a Secret source is configured, you can utilize it by including a configuration value like `secret.key-name`. The secret source will then be queried for a secret named `key-name`. If the secret store has no secret by that name, it will prevent the application from starting up. This effect applies to any other "entity" (cache, authentication, provider), for obvious reasons you can't use a secret in the configuration for your secret source.
