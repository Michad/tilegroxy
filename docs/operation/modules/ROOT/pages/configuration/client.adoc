[cols="1,3,1,1,1"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Default

| UserAgent
| The user agent to include in outgoing http requests.
| string
| No
| tilegroxy/VERSION

| MaxLength
| The maximum Content-Length to allow incoming responses
| int
| No
| 10 MiB

| UnknownLength
| Allow responses that are missing a Content-Length header, this could lead to excessive memory usage
| bool
| No

| string[]

| 200

| Headers

| map[string]string
| No
| None

| RewriteContentTypes
| Replaces ``Content-Type``s that match the key with the value. This is to handle servers returning a generic content type. Mapping to an empty string that will cause tilegroxy to intuit the Content-Type by inspecting the contents - this may be inaccurate for MVT. This only applies after the check that Content-Type is valid according to the `ContentTypes` parameter meaning your original Content-Type will need to be in both parameters to be used
| map[string]string
| No
| {"application/octet-stream": ""}
