= Client

Configures how the HTTP client should operate for tile requests that require calling an external HTTP(s) server.

Configuration options:

|===
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description

| UserAgent
| string
| No
| tilegroxy/VERSION
| The user agent to include in outgoing http requests.

| MaxLength
| int
| No
| 10 MiB
| The maximum Content-Length to allow incoming responses

| UnknownLength
| bool
| No
| false
| Allow responses that are missing a Content-Length header, this could lead to excessive memory usage

| ContentTypes
| string[]
| No
| image/png, image/jpg
| The content-types to allow remote servers to return. Anything else will be interpreted as an error

| StatusCodes
| int[]
| No
| 200
| The status codes from the remote server to consider successful

| Headers
| map[string]string
| No
| None
| Include these headers in requests

| RewriteContentTypes
| map[string]string
| No
| {"application/octet-stream": ""}
| Replaces ``Content-Type``s that match the key with the value. This is to handle servers returning a generic content type. Mapping to an empty string that will cause tilegroxy to intuit the Content-Type by inspecting the contents - this may be inaccurate for MVT. This only applies after the check that Content-Type is valid according to the `ContentTypes` parameter meaning your original Content-Type will need to be in both parameters to be used
