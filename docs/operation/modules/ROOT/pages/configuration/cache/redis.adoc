= Redis

Cache tiles using redis or another redis-compatible key-value store.

Name should be "redis"

Configuration options:

|===
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description

| host
| String
| No
| 127.0.0.1
| The host of the redis server. A convenience equivalent to supplying `servers` with a single entry. Do not supply both this and `servers`

| port
| int
| No
| 6379
| The port of the redis server. A convenience equivalent to supplying `servers` with a single entry. Do not supply both this and `servers`

| db
| int
| No
| 0
| Database number, defaults to 0. Unused in cluster mode

| keyprefix
| string
| No
| None
| A prefix to use for keys stored in cache. Serves a similar purpose as `db` in avoiding collisions when multiple applications use the same redis

| username
| string
| No
| None
| Username to use to authenticate with redis

| password
| string
| No
| None
| Password to use to authenticate with redis

| mode
| string
| No
| standalone
| Controls operating mode of redis. Can be `standalone`, `ring` or `cluster`. Standalone is a single redis server. Ring distributes entries to multiple servers without any replication https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/ring.html[(more details)]. Cluster is a proper redis cluster.

| ttl
| uint32
| No
| 1 day
| How long cache entries should persist for in seconds. Cannot be disabled.

| servers
| Array of `host` and `port`
| No
| host and port
| The list of servers to connect to supplied as an array of objects, each with a host and key parameter. This should only have a single entry when operating in standalone mode. If this is unspecified it uses the standalone `host` and `port` parameters as a default, therefore this shouldn't be specified at the same time as those
