[cols="1,3,1,1,1"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Default

| host
| The host of the redis server. A convenience equivalent to supplying `servers` with a single entry. Do not supply both this and `servers`
| String
| No
| 127.0.0.1

| port
| The port of the redis server. A convenience equivalent to supplying `servers` with a single entry. Do not supply both this and `servers`
| int
| No
| 6379

| db
| Database number, defaults to 0. Unused in cluster mode
| int
| No
| 0

| keyprefix
| A prefix to use for keys stored in cache. Serves a similar purpose as `db` in avoiding collisions when multiple applications use the same redis
| string
| No
| None

| username
| Username to use to authenticate with redis
| string
| No
| None

| password
| Password to use to authenticate with redis
| string
| No
| None

| mode
| Controls operating mode of redis. Can be `standalone`, `ring` or `cluster`. Standalone is a single redis server. Ring distributes entries to multiple servers without any replication https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/ring.html[(more details)]. Cluster is a proper redis cluster.
| string
| No
| standalone

| ttl
| How long cache entries should persist for in seconds. Cannot be disabled.
| uint32
| No
| 1 day

| servers
| The list of servers to connect to supplied as an array of objects, each with a host and key parameter. This should only have a single entry when operating in standalone mode. If this is unspecified it uses the standalone `host` and `port` parameters as a default, therefore this shouldn't be specified at the same time as those
| Array of `host` and `port`
| No
| host and port
