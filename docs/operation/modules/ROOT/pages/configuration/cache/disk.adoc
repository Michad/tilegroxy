= Disks

Stores the cache entries as files in a location on the filesystem.

If the filesystem is purely local then you will experience inconsistent performance if using tilegroxy in a high-availability deployment.

Files are stored in a flat structure inside the specified directory. No cleanup process is included inside of `tilegroxy` itself. It is recommended you use an external cleanup process to avoid running out of disk space.

Name should be "disk"

Configuration options:

|===
| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description

| path
| string
| Yes
| None
| The absolute path to the directory to store cache entries within. Directory (and tree) will be created if it does not already exist

| filemode
| uint32
| No
| 0777
| A https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FileMode[Go filemode] as an integer to use for all created files/directories. This might change in the future to support a more conventional unix permission notation
