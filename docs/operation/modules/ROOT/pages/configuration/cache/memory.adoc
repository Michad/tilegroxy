= Memory

A local in-memory cache. This stores the tiles in the memory of the tilegroxy daemon itself.

*This is not recommended for production use.* It is meant for development and testing use-cases only. Setting this cache too high can cause stability issues for the service and this cache is not distributed so can cause inconsistent performance when deploying in a high-availability production environment.

Name should be "memory"

Configuration options:

[cols="1,3,1,1,1"]

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Default 

| maxsize
| Maximum number of tiles to hold in the cache. Must be at least 10. Setting this too high can cause out-of-memory panics. This is not a guaranteed setting, which entry is evicted when exceeding this size is an implementation detail and the size can temporarily grow somewhat larger.
| uint16
| No
| 100

| ttl
| Maximum time to live for cache entries in seconds
| uint32
| No
| 3600
