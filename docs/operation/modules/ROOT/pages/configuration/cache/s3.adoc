= S3

Cache tiles as objects in an AWS S3 bucket.

Ensure the user you're using has proper permissions for reading and writing objects in the bucket.  The permissions required are the minimal set you'd expect: GetObject and PutObject.  It's highly recommended to also grant ListBucket permissions, otherwise the log will contain misleading 403 error messages for every cache miss.  Also ensure the user has access to the KMS key if using bucket encryption.

If you're using a Directory Bucket AKA Express One Zone there's a few things to configure:

* Ensure `storageclass` is set to "EXPRESS_ONEZONE"
* The bucket contains the full name including suffix. For example: `+my-tilegroxy-cache--use1-az6--x-s3+`


Name should be "s3"
