= Ref

Ref refers requests to another layer. This is pointless by itself but can be useful when combined with other providers to avoid repeating yourself.

For instance you can have a layer with a complex client configuration that utilizes a `pattern` and points to a WMS server with the WMS layer being specified by a placeholder, then several other layers using `Ref` that fill in the blank.

Name should be "ref"

Configuration options:

[cols="1,3,1,1,1"]
