= CGI

The CGI provider allows a call-out to an external executable on the local system that's responsible for generating the tile. This allows tilegroxy to act as the HTTP server for a CGI program like Apache httpd or nginx traditionally acts. The flagship use-case for this is to integrate with https://www.mapserver.org[MapServer]. A full example is available in link:../examples/mapserver/[examples/mapserver].
