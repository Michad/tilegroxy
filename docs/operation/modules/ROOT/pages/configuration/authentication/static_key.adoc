= Static Key

Requires incoming requests have a specific key supplied as a "Bearer" token in a "Authorization" Header.

It is recommended you employ caution with this option. It should be regarded as a protection against casual web scrapers but not true security. It is recommended only for development and internal ("intranet") use-cases. Does not include any authz logic.
