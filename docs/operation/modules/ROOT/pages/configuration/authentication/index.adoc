= Authentication

Implements incoming auth schemes. This is primarily meant for authentication but does include some authorization by limiting access to specific layers via JWT or custom schemes.

Requests that do not comply with authentication requirements will receive a 401 Unauthorized HTTP status code.

When supplying authentication ensure you include the `name` parameter.
